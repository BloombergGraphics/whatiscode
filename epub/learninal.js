So we bundle those up in methods and attributes. This is cool because everything kind of stays together and you can easily find out all the things you can DO with a document. Programmers spend a lot of time looking for the methods and attributes of their objects. Because this is about understanding what programmers do, I'm going to show you a list of every method and attribute on the document object. Here it goes. It's very long.
